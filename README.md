Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a recreation of the tic-tac-toe game that I am building based off of a tutorial for React.js. 

The game is pretty simple to play and very common, but in case you are not familiar with it, here is a link that desccribes the game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

Features recommended to add in the future:

Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
