Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a recreation of the tic-tac-toe game that I am building based off of a tutorial for React.js. 

The game is pretty simple to play and very common, but in case you are not familiar with it, here is a link that desccribes the game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

Setup:

git clone https://github.com/garyCoffey/tic-tac-toe.git
